# to-do-application

## Overview
In this project, you will build a functional To-Do List Application using Python from scratch. This assignment will help you strengthen your understanding of Python concepts such as syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and error handling, all while creating a practical, interactive command-line application.


## Features

- Add new tasks to your list.
- View all current tasks.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Input validation to handle invalid menu selections.
- Error handling for user-friendly interaction.

## Notes
- Tasks are stored in memory only; closing the program will clear the list.

- Inputs are case-sensitive when deleting tasks.
